\title{UAVCAN/CAN Physical Layer Specification v0.1}

\section*{Overview}

The UAVCAN/CAN physical layer specification (UCANPHY) defines electromechanical conventions for {UAVCAN/CAN}
optimized for use in the avionics of manned and unmanned aircraft as well as in high-integrity robotic systems.
The goal of UCANPHY is to maximize cross-vendor compatibility, ensure consistency across the ecosystem, and
prevent some common design pitfalls.

UAVCAN is an open technology for real-time intravehicular distributed computing and communication
based on modern networking standards.
The name UAVCAN stands for \emph{Uncomplicated Application-level Vehicular Computing And Networking}.

UAVCAN/CAN is a standard transport layer protocol defined by the UAVCAN specification for use with
the CAN\footnote{Controller Area Network} protocol.
